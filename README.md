# Description
A quirky and fun website for users who love dogs and hate being bored. This appliction allows the user to generate a random and fun activity for them to accomplish when bored while also displaying a cute dog image that encourages to do said activity. 
This application was created with late 90s website inspiration and bright old school design.
We used HTML, Javascript, Css, Skeleton wireframe, Bored API and Dog API.
